## Introduction

This program is a 2D Finite Element demonstration and learning tool.
Originally it was a Java Applet that I wrote for my degree project many years ago. To bring it up to date and to learn the modern languages and structures I have converted it to a TypeScript web application. I have used Three.js as a way of representing the Finite Element mesh on screen and make the model interactive.

I would like one day to publish this for public use so that it can do what I intended which is let students use it to experiment with 2D Finite element and see the various results and effects of changes to their created models.

## Future Development

Because this is my first Typescript/Javascript application project there will be many improvements that I can make to the design which I am finding out about as I go along. Your comments will be welcome on the coding, structure and tuning of this project and also on the use of Three.js.

I also had to learn the basic principle of Finite Element before I could write the Java code. If there is anyone out there who knows this subject and would like to take a look at it, have an experiment with the tool and let me have comments about how it can be improved or any mistakes that they find.

## Documentation

I have available my dissertation which explains how the program is designed and the methods the application uses to solve the mathematical equations.
